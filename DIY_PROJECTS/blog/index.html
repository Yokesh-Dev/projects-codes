        <h5 class="card-title"> Stress is a part of your life.</h5>
       
If you don't have stress, then your mind is ready to wind up and die.
The moment you open social media in the morning,
there are 10,000 gurus telling you 20,000 ways to live your life.
Every Tom, Dick and Harry's mother and dog is running a line on how to live your life
and what is wrong with it.
And they are all wrong because their conditioning is not the same as your conditioning.
You and I could be both South Indians,
but we could have been born in different parts of the world with different
set of rules that makes us very different.
There are three things you need to do if you think you're getting stressful.
One is just take a break and breathe man.
The best way to calm your mind is to do deep breathing.
And it's called box breathing.
Like the time of breathing in, holding the breath,
breathing out, holding the breath.
It has to be the same.
You will be amazed at which how clarity of thought starts coming
to your mind and stress goes off.
That's the first tangible thing you can do to get rid of stress.
The second thing is we have to remember
stress is there so that you can appreciate the peace that comes off to me.
Enjoy that stress a little bit.
Know that this will, this too shall pass.
So if stress is going to affect your blood pressure,
it is going to shoot up to 140 by accepting this.
Maybe it will still be 110.
It will still have the stress.
But the impact of the stress is much less.
And find something that gives you fun without a payback.
So play with the dog.
It loves you.
This goes who you are.
It's not expecting that you give it something in return.
